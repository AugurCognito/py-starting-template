# /report — persist findings

Write investigation results to `docs/reports/<yyyy-mm-dd>-<slug>.md` when you discover something worth keeping (root cause, benchmark, survey, decision input).

Structure:

```markdown

# <Question investigated>

## Answer
Lead with the conclusion in 2-3 sentences.

## Evidence
What was checked, what was found (file:line references, command outputs, URLs).

## Implications
What should change because of this, if anything.
```

Rules: capture the WHY. Evidence includes the actual command output (trimmed to the relevant lines), not the assertion that it passed. Cite precisely enough that a skeptic can re-verify — `file:line` references and URLs, never pasted code blocks. Absolute dates only. If the finding decided something, also append the decision to `docs/decisions.md`.
